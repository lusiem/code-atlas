# code-atlas

**Multi-language code intelligence MCP server** — gives Claude Code (and any MCP client) a structured view of your codebase instead of raw text: symbol search, file outlines, AST pattern queries, cross-file references, call/type hierarchies, import graphs, precise LSP-backed answers, and local-embedding semantic search — with game-engine asset understanding coming next.

Instead of grepping and reading whole files, the model asks questions like *"outline this file"*, *"who calls `parseConfig`?"*, *"how does the request handler reach the DB layer?"* — and gets compact, token-efficient answers backed by a persistent tree-sitter index.

> **Status: early development.** Structural indexing, cross-file resolution, and the call graph work across 11 languages. See the roadmap below.

## How it works

```
your repo ──scan (gitignore-aware)──> tree-sitter parse ──> SQLite index (symbols, imports,
                                                             occurrences, call/type edges, FTS5)
                                                                   │
Claude Code ◄──────────── MCP tools over stdio ────────────────────┘
```

- **Persistent index** at `<repo>/.code-atlas/index.db` (self-gitignored), incrementally refreshed by content hash.
- **Live** — a gitignore-aware file watcher reindexes saves within a debounce beat and re-resolves only the affected files (`--no-watch` or `"watch": false` to disable).
- **Zero config** — point it at a repo root and it works. Optional `code-atlas.json` for include/exclude tweaks.
- **Everything local** — your code never leaves your machine.

## Install & use with Claude Code

```sh
git clone <this repo> && cd code-atlas
npm install && npm run build

claude mcp add code-atlas -- node /path/to/code-atlas/dist/index.js serve
```

(Once published: `claude mcp add code-atlas -- npx -y code-atlas-mcp serve`.)

The server indexes the current working directory; pass `--root <path>` to override.

### CLI

```sh
node dist/index.js index [--root <path>]              # one-shot index build (debugging / warm-up)
node dist/index.js serve [--root <path>] [--no-watch] [--no-lsp] [--no-embeddings] [--no-download]
                                                      # MCP server on stdio
```

## Tools

| Tool | What it answers |
|---|---|
| `project_overview` | What is this project? Languages, sizes, index freshness. Call first. |
| `search_symbols` | Where is *X* defined? FTS + fuzzy over names and doc comments, filterable by kind/language/path. |
| `semantic_search` | *"Where is retry backoff implemented?"* — natural-language search, hybrid keyword+embedding ranking, fully local. |
| `get_file_outline` | What's in this file? Hierarchical signatures without reading source. |
| `get_symbol_info` | Everything about one symbol (by id, position, or name) incl. docs and source. |
| `ast_query` | Raw tree-sitter S-expression queries — structural search regex can't do. |
| `find_references` | Who uses this symbol? Exact (LSP) when available, else resolved usages first, name-matches as candidates. |
| `go_to_definition` | Definition of the identifier at a position. LSP-exact with index fallback. |
| `call_hierarchy` | Who calls this / what does it call, as a tree. `[lsp 1.00]` edges when a language server is running. |
| `type_hierarchy` | Supertypes and subtypes over extends/implements edges. |
| `get_dependencies` | File import graph, both directions (imports / imported-by). |
| `trace_path` | Shortest call chain between two symbols. |
| `get_scene_structure` | Godot scene node tree with attached scripts, instanced sub-scenes, and signal connections (handlers resolved to symbols). |
| `find_asset_references` | Which scenes/prefabs use this script? Reverse lookup across Godot res:// paths, Unity GUIDs (via .meta), and Unreal modules. |
| `search_reflection` | All `UPROPERTY(Replicated)`, `[SerializeField]`, `@export` vars, signals — engine reflection markers across the workspace. |
| `index_status` / `reindex` | Index health and manual refresh. |

Cross-file answers are **LSP-first with a structural floor**: when a language server is available
(found on PATH or auto-acquired into a per-user cache), references/definitions/hover/call
hierarchies are exact and tagged `lsp`; everywhere else, heuristic import/name resolution answers
with a confidence score per edge. Servers: typescript-language-server + pyright (npm), gopls
(go install), rust-analyzer + clangd (pinned, SHA-256-verified release binaries), Eclipse JDT LS
for Java (needs a Java 21+ runtime — detected via PATH/JAVA_HOME), kotlin-language-server (needs
any JRE), and csharp-ls for C# (needs the .NET SDK; installed as a dotnet tool — deliberately not
Microsoft's Roslyn LSP, whose license is VS-only). Missing runtimes degrade that language to
structural, reported honestly in `index_status`. A first-time acquisition (download + boot) never
blocks a query: tools wait up to 8 s, then answer structurally while the server finishes starting.
Disable with `--no-lsp`; disable auto-download with `--no-download`.

**Semantic search** embeds every function/class (signature + doc + body) with a code-tuned local
model — `jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-code`, quantized ONNX — and fuses cosine similarity with
BM25 keyword rank. Everything stays on your machine. The ONNX runtime (~220 MB) and model
(~150 MB) are **not** part of this package: they download to the per-user cache the first time you
call `semantic_search`, never at install, and structural tools never wait on them. Until coverage
completes, results are keyword-weighted and say so. Embedding a 60k-symbol repo takes ~15 minutes
of background time, once; after that only edited symbols re-embed. `"embeddings": {"model":
"fast"}` swaps in a 4× faster general-purpose model; `--no-embeddings` turns the layer off.

## Languages

**Indexing today:** TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, Rust, Go, Java, Kotlin, C#, GDScript.

**Game engines:** engine assets index alongside code — Godot `.tscn`/`.tres` scenes (node trees,
script attachments, signal connections, autoloads; `res://` resolved per `project.godot`, monorepos
of many projects included), Unity `.unity`/`.prefab`/`.asset` + `.meta` GUID maps (MonoBehaviour →
C# class links, serialized references), and Unreal `.uproject`/`.uplugin`/`Build.cs` module graphs
plus reflection-macro search over headers. Binary formats (`.uasset`, Blueprints, `.scn`) are out
of scope by design.

## Roadmap

1. ~~Structural core: scanner, SQLite+FTS5 index, TS/JS/Python extractors, first 6 tools~~ ✅
2. ~~All 11 language extractors, cross-file import resolution, call graph (`find_references`, `call_hierarchy`, `trace_path`)~~ ✅
3. ~~File watcher + incremental reindexing (scoped re-resolution, schema migrations)~~ ✅
4. ~~LSP layer (auto-acquired ts-ls/pyright/gopls; checksum-pinned rust-analyzer/clangd binaries; JDT LS/kotlin-language-server/csharp-ls with JRE/.NET detection; precise references/definitions/hover/call hierarchy with graceful fallback)~~ ✅
5. ~~Local-embedding semantic search (`semantic_search`, hybrid BM25+vector reciprocal-rank fusion, lazy model download, incremental re-embedding)~~ ✅
6. ~~Game-engine adapters: GDScript grammar (vendored wasm build), Godot scenes/autoloads, Unity prefabs/GUIDs, Unreal module graph + reflection search~~ ✅ — Godot editor LSP (TCP 6005) still to come
7. npm publish, docs, benchmarks

## Development

```sh
npm install        # also copies grammar wasm files into grammars/
npm test           # vitest: extractor golden tests, store, scanner, MCP end-to-end
npm run lint
npm run dev serve  # run from source via tsx
```

Position convention: lines are 1-based, columns 0-based, paths root-relative with forward slashes.
